# Overview

The `zksync_adapter` is an example implementation of an adapter within the Avail Nexus ecosystem. It runs as a sidecar to ZKSync's zkStack chains, pulling proofs after proof generation of each batch, and submitting those proofs to Nexus for aggregation. Below is the status of the current development and implementation for the `zksync_adapter`.
